\textbf{Learning Outcomes}

The problems are designed to build conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills. The emphasis is on learning to find, evaluate and build confidence.
The specific tasks include: 

   - Enumerate and count
   
   - Apply Bayes' rule
   
   - Calculate probabilities for independent events
  
   - Back up and support work with relevant explanations

### Exercises 

1.  (*Lady Tasting Tea*) In a famous experiment conducted by Sir. R. A. Fisher, 8 cups of tea - 4 prepared by pouring the milk first and then the tea and 4 prepared by pouring the tea first and then the milk -- were  presented in random order to Muriel Bristol who claimed she could tell the difference. 

The methods employed in the experiment were fully disclosed to the subject and she had to select the 4 cups prepared with the "milk poured first". 


```{r teacups, echo=F, fig.align = "center", out.width="85%"}
#including an image file
knitr::include_graphics("problem2au23fig1.JPG")
```

  
  a. The sample space $S$ for this experiment consists of all groupings of 4 cups selected from eight. How many such groups are there? Write your answer symbolically first and also calculate it in the code chunk below.
  
We have that the the sample space S, has size = $\binom{8}{4}$.  
  
```{r count_s}
#calculate number of elements in S
## in the code chunk below

S_size = choose(8,4)

```
  
We find that the size of S is equal to `r S_size` .  
  
  b. Let $E$ denote the event that there are 3 cups with "milk poured first" and 1 cup with "tea poured first". How many elements are in $E$? Write your answer symbolically first and also calculate it in a code chunk below.
  
Let $|E|$ denote the cardinality of the set $E$. Then:

$|E| = \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{4}{1}$.
  
```{r give_me_a_name}
#calculate number of elements in E

E_size <- choose(4,3)*choose(4,1)

```

We see that this exact size is `r E_size`.

 c. If the lady has no ESP and is just guessing randomly, it is reasonable to assume that every outcome in $S$ is equally likely. Calculate $P(E)$ under this assumption. You may do this in a code chunk.
 
 $P(E) = \frac{|E|}{|S|}$
 
```{r}
prob_E = E_size/S_size
```
 
We see that $P(E)=$ `r prob_E`.


2. One common application of conditional probabilities is in calculating inverse probabilities. For example,
consider the following tree diagram of probabilities relating a screening test for a disease with the actual presence of disease. 


```{r treediagram, echo = FALSE}

treeDiag(main = c("Disease status", "Test result"),
         p1 = c(0.001, 0.999),
         p2 = list(c(0.98, "?"), c(0.01, "?")),
         out1 = c("Present", "Absent"),
         out2 = c("Positive", "Negative"),
         showSol = FALSE,
         showWork = FALSE,
         solwd = 0.5,
         digits = 6)

```

Let $D$ denote that a randomly selected individual has the disease, and $T$ the event that the screening test is positive. 

The first (primary) branch of the tree gives \emph{unconditional} probabilities of disease being present or absent:
$$P(D) = 0.001, P(D^{c}) = 0.999$$ 
while the secondary branches state conditional probabilities of the test coming out positive (or negative) given the disease status. For example, you are given that
$$P(T|D) = 0.98, P(T|D^{c}) = 0.01.$$

   a. Fill in the values in the tree diagram for the conditional probabilities $P(T^{c}|D)$ and $P(T^{c}|D^{c})$ indicated by a "?"  (Hint: conditional probability follows Law of Complements.)
   
Recall   $P(T^c | D) + P(T|D) = 1$

```{r treediagram 2, echo = FALSE}

treeDiag(main = c("Disease status", "Test result"),
         p1 = c(0.001, 0.999),
         p2 = list(c(0.98, 1 - 0.98), c(0.01, 1-0.01)),
         out1 = c("Present", "Absent"),
         out2 = c("Positive", "Negative"),
         showSol = FALSE,
         showWork = FALSE,
         solwd = 0.5,
         digits = 6)

```


   b. Suppose the test is positive. What is the probability that the person actually has disease? In other words, find the inverse conditional probability: $P(D|T)$
   
  Hint: see example 4.2 from "Chapter 4: Conditional Probability" 

By Bayes' Rule we have

 \begin{align*}
 P(D|T) &= \frac{P(D \cap T)}{P(T)} \\
 &= \frac{P(T|D) \times P(D)}{P(T)} \\
 &= \frac{0.98 \times 0.001}{P(T)}
 \end{align*}
 
 To find $P(T)$, i.e. the probability of a positive test,  we need to add $P(D \cap T)$ and $P(D^C \cap T)$. Each of these intersection probabilities follow from the chain rule of probabilities:
 
 \begin{align*}
 P(D \cap T) &= P(P(T|D) \times P(D) = 0.98 \times 0.001 \\
 P(D^c \cap T) &= P(T|D^c) \times P(D^c) = 0.01 \times 0.999
 \end{align*}
 
 The calculations are shown below.
 
```{r calc_inv_prob}
Prob_T_given_D <- 0.98 #given: P(T|D)
Prob_D <- 0.001 #law of complements
Prob_T_given_Dc <- 0.01 #given: P(T|D^c)
Prob_Dc <- 1 - Prob_D #law of complements

#use chain rule to find intersection of probabilities
Prob_D_and_T <- Prob_T_given_D * Prob_D
Prob_Dc_and_T <- Prob_T_given_Dc * Prob_Dc

#find P(T) by adding intersection probabilities
Prob_T <- Prob_D_and_T + Prob_Dc_and_T

#calculcate inverse conditional probaility by Baye's Rule
(Prob_D_given_T <- (Prob_T_given_D * Prob_D)/{Prob_T})
```
 
Using the above math we have that $P(D|T) =$ `r round(Prob_D_given_T,4)`

3. Suppose that string of tree lights you just bought has twenty-four bulbs
wired in series. If each bulb has a 99.9% chance of “working” when the current
is applied, what is the probability that the string itself will not work? You may assume that bulb failures are independent.

We must find the probability of at least one bulb failing, since this will cause the series to fail. We can find this using complements.

Note that the complement of at least one bulb failing, is that ALL the bulbs WORK.

Let $A_i$ denote the event that bulb i WORKS.

Let $B$ denote the event that the string of lights works (i.e. no bulb failures),
i.e. $B = A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \dots A_{24}$.

By independence of $A_i$s, we have that 
$P(B) = P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \dots A_{24}) = \prod_{i=1}^{24} P(A_i) = (0.999)^{24}$.

The probability the string does work is `r (.999)^24`, so the probability that the string will not work is `r 1-(.999)^24`.
